# Tutorials for Pruna AI libraries

[Pruna AI](https://www.pruna.ai/) makes, in one line of code, any AI model faster, cheaper, smaller, greener on any hardware. It covers CV, NLP, audio, graphs for predictive and generative AI.

- `pruna`: Package to smash your AI model to make it more efficient without losing quality. For this, you only need to call `pruna.smash()`.
- `pruna_engine`: Package to run your AI model more efficiently without changing your pipeline.

## Setup
1. Install the [Pruna package](https://pypi.org/project/pruna/) from PyPI. 
2. Fill the [early access form](https://z0halsaff74.typeform.com/pruna-access?typeform-source=www.pruna.ai) to get a trial pruna api_key.
3. Choose the notebook you want to run in this repo and run it!

## Repository structure
### Text Generation

We show examples of how to use pruna on different NLP tasks in the [text folder](https://github.com/PrunaAI/Tutorials/tree/main/pruna/notebooks/text-generation). It includes a list of examples on many generative Large Language Models (LLMs) across different available compression methods and tasks.

### Image Generation

We show examples of how to use pruna on different CV tasks in the [image folder](https://github.com/PrunaAI/Tutorials/tree/main/pruna/notebooks/image-generation). It includes a list of examples on many generative Stable Diffusion (SD) models across different available compression methods and tasks.
